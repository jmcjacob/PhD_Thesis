 - Minor
  - "allows a model to images when it is uncertain" -> "allows a model to reject images when it is uncertain"
 
 
Chapter 1 - Introduction
 - Major
  - Added 2 paragrpahs in Section 1.1 on the state of digital pathology and dermatology.
  - Changes "study" to "chapter" in multiple instances.
  - TODO ADD MORE ON PROBLEM AREA AND DATASETS
  - Section 1.2 Paragraph 5: specified what self-supervised representation learning is and how RotNet learns features that can be used for downstream tasks.
  - Section 1.3 Paragraph 1: specified clearer when rejection happens.

Chapter 2 - Active Learning
 - Major
  - Justified why clicks was used to measure annotation effort
  - Added an active component to Algorithm 1
  - Section 2.4.3 Added explination on why tile-based active learning is used.
  - Expanded 2.5 to add more depth and explain why certain results were achieved.
  - Added block diagram of algorithm to page 22
  
 - Minor
  - Moved publication details to end of introduction.
  - Table 2.2 moved to the bottom of the page.
  - Table 2.2 indicated best performing for each metric.
