\section{Introduction to Problem}
\label{sec:intoduction_to_problem}
This is where details about the medical issues and how they can be solved used artificial intelligence. This is where the limitations of AI will be discussed.


\section{Research Contributions}
\label{sec:research_contributions}

In this thesis we propose a pathway used to train medical image analysis systems that can take advantage of unannotated data and produce a system that is both selective and cost sensitive in order to minimise risk used as part of a clinical pipeline. The contributions that form the building blocks for this pathway are as followed:

\begin{itemize}
	\item An active learning framework for histopathology patches that samples larger patches for annotation to increase annotation throughput without adding additional work to annotators.
	
	\item Multi-directional contrastive predictive coding, A unsupervised representation learning algorithm built for medical images with no clear directionality.

	\item A empirical comparison of calibration methods for deep medical image classifiers on histopathology patches and skin lesions images.
	
	\item A comparison of selective classification methods in both binary and multi class settings covering Bayesian neural networks, calibrated neural networks and purpose built models for selective classification.
	
	\item A proposed method for selective classification that makes decisions based on expected costs in situations with asymmetric misclassification costs.
	
	\item Something about Selective Triage
	
	\item Something about dataset generalisation
\end{itemize}
