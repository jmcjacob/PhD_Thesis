\section{Research Motivations}
\label{sec:motivation}
In recent times, contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have exhibited remarkable results across various fields~\citep{sarker2021deep}. The upsurge in deep learning, a machine learning approach where a model with deep layers learns meaningful representations and task-specific outputs (such as classification tasks) jointly, is the primary reason for this progress~\citep{lecun2015deep}. By eliminating the need for complex feature engineering, this approach leads to enhanced model performance, with the learned representations being more task specific. In the medical domain, researchers have explored the potential of AI and deep learning algorithms to improve the performance of medical image analysis tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection across different modalities. Integrating these techniques intelligently into clinical workflows can aid in enhancing efficiency by automating complex and time-consuming tasks requiring expert knowledge. 

An example of AI integration in a clinical domain can be observed in the realm of digital pathology—an increasingly burgeoning discipline encompassing the application of digital tools and methodologies for the analysis and interpretation of medical images. AI has found practical utility within the digital pathology clinical pipeline by providing automated analyses, thereby alleviating the time-consuming burden for clinicians, and aiding in diagnostic decision-making processes. A notable challenge encountered by clinical pathologists pertains to the evaluation of entire slide images due to their sheer size, rendering a comprehensive assessment daunting. Nevertheless, AI algorithms demonstrate competence in analysing entire slides, identifying critical regions of interest, and furnishing supplementary information, such as nuclei counts by classification, thereby facilitating the diagnostic process~\citep{dimitriou2019deep}. Significant strides in this area encompass the development of Spatially Constrained Convolutional Neural Network for nucleus detection~\citep{sirinukunwattana2016locality} and the Camelyon digital pathology challenge—an open science initiative aimed at developing algorithms for detecting cancer metastasis in whole slide images of lymph node sections~\citep{bejnordi2017diagnostic}.

Artificial intelligence is rapidly becoming a realistic prospect in dermatology. Empirical investigations have demonstrated that AI algorithms exhibit diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of skin cancer experts when it comes to diagnosing skin lesions in dermoscopic images ~\citep{liopyris2022artificial}. Dermoscopy, as a method for capturing images of skin lesions, finds utility in the interface between primary and secondary care. However, reviewing these referred images poses a substantial time burden for dermatologists, making it an area where AI's implementation could significantly alleviate their workload, thereby allowing them to devote more attention to more complex cases. Nonetheless, the integration of AI in dermatology is a multifaceted endeavour due to the intricate nature of patient pathways within the domain. Hence, the comprehensive evaluation of AI interventions mandates clinically-led research studies. A notable illustration of ongoing work in the realm of AI for dermatology lies in the efforts of the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)~\footnote{International Skin Imaging Collaboration: \url{https://www.isic-archive.com/}}, an organization dedicated to collecting and disseminating images for clinical and computer vision research.

Although deep learning algorithms have demonstrated significant improvement in performance for medical image analysis tasks, they necessitate large, annotated datasets to train models and construct meaningful representations necessary for optimal performance. However, acquiring annotations for medical images can be an expensive process, requiring specialised training and a substantial amount of time, compounded by the need for multiple annotations due to inter-observer variability. This challenge has been acknowledged as a primary issue in utilising deep learning algorithms for medical image analysis tasks, as reported in a survey conducted by \cite{litjens2017survey}.

\section{Cost of Annotations}
The limited capacity for annotation in medical image analysis has prompted the exploration of methods designed to address this challenge. One such approach is active learning~\citep{settles2009active}, a machine learning technique that entails iteratively selecting informative samples from a large unannotated dataset to be annotated by an expert, with the aim of enhancing the performance of a predictive model (Figure~\ref{fig:pool_based_active_learning}). The primary objective of active learning is to achieve high accuracy while utilising fewer annotated examples than conventional supervised learning techniques.

\begin{figure}[b]

	\caption{Pool-based active learning framework.}
	\label{fig:pool_based_active_learning}
\end{figure}

For instance, in the field of dermatology, active learning can be employed to identify representative samples from a vast pool of unannotated images, which can then be annotated by dermatologists. By adopting this strategy, the dermatologist can concentrate on the most informative images, instead of annotating images at random. Despite limitations in the amount of annotated data that can be generated, which is often due to financial or temporal constraints. Consequently, by selectively annotating the most informative images, active learning has the potential to enhance the performance of the resulting machine learning model, thereby reducing the need for additional annotated examples.

Active learning has demonstrated its efficacy in traditional machine learning environments~\citep{settles2009active}, but its applicability in conjunction with deep learning algorithms is subject to limitations that can potentially impede its effectiveness. A particular issue that arises is a selection bias problem~\citep{sener2017active}, as active learning algorithms tend to prioritise the selection of the most informative samples. This can engender a biased dataset that is not reflective of the entire population, ultimately resulting in a deep learning model that acquires feature representations that are not generalisable to unseen data. Consequently, suboptimal classification performance can occur.

Active learning has been shown to be effective in mitigating issues arising from the limited annotation budget; however, further improvements in performance can be achieved by maximising the utility of the unannotated pool. One approach to achieving this is through unsupervised representation learning, which is capable of learning representative features from unannotated images~\citep{bengio2013representation}. The acquired representation can then be transferred to other models, thereby reducing the amount of annotated data required to produce a high-performing model. This can help to alleviate the burden on the active learning algorithm in balancing the selection of representative and informative samples. Unsupervised representation learning is typically achieved using either reconstruction or self-supervised methods.

A reconstruction method aims to learn by generating new examples, such as an autoencoder model that compresses its input data into a lower-dimensional latent space and then reconstructs the original data. The learned latent space can be reused as an encoder in a classification model, which can then be trained in a supervised fashion. In contrast, a self-supervised representation method uses a pretext task to learn representational tasks in a supervised fashion. One example of this is the RotNet method~\citep{gidaris2018unsupervised}, which involves rotating images and having the model predict the rotation of the image. In order to predict the rotation of an image the model has to learn to represent localise salient objects in the images and their relationship to other objects in the image. These learned representations can then be subsequently be transferred to other tasks such as classification. By leveraging these unsupervised representation learning methods, it is possible to extract meaningful features from unannotated data, thereby reducing the burden of annotation and improving the performance of downstream machine learning tasks.

\section{Triage Misdiagnosis}
The limited annotation and the utilisation of techniques to enhance the performance of a specified task may compromise the model's robustness towards images that are outside its training data, such as new disease classifications or diverse image capture conditions. Consequently, the model must be trained to acknowledge the uncertainty of its predictions, which presents a challenge for deep learning algorithms due to their lack of interpretability~\citep{zhang2018visual} and inadequately calibrated predictive probabilities~\citep{gal2016dropout}. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate methods to better calibrate deep learning algorithms and adopt selective classification approaches to reject images that the model is ill-equipped to handle when making a prediction on new image.

Calibration denotes the systematic procedure of conforming the anticipated probabilities of a model with the authentic probabilities of the target variable. When applied in the realm of deep learning, this procedure necessitates adapting the model's output to match the actual distribution of outcomes in the population under consideration~\citep{guo2017calibration}. Generally, three distinct methodologies are utilised to improve the calibration of deep learning algorithm outputs, namely model regularisation, post-hoc calibration, and Bayesian neural networks. Model regularisation involves the imposition of regularisation during the training phase, while post-hoc calibration entails fine-tuning the output probabilities after the model has undergone training. Additionally, Bayesian neural networks are acknowledged to be intrinsically superior for calibration purposes.

The use of asymmetrical costs is a modification that can be implemented to address the varying costs associated with misclassifications stemming from false positives and false negatives. False positives refer to cases where a healthy patient is incorrectly diagnosed as having a disease, while false negatives denote instances where a patient with a disease is erroneously identified as healthy. The consequences of these types of misclassifications can be vastly dissimilar. In the context of a skin lesion classification scenario, a false positive may lead to unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions such as biopsies, additional testing, and heightened anxiety. Conversely, a false negative could result in delayed treatment, missed diagnoses, and ultimately, a worsened patient outcome. The integration of selective classification alongside asymmetrical costs may yield selective classification systems that reject images that could lead to higher costs if misdiagnoses, thereby minimising the costs associated with such misclassifications.

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/selective_classification.png}
	\caption{Selective Classification framework.}
	\label{fig:selective_classification}
\end{figure}

Selective classification, or classification with a reject option~\citep{chow1957optimum}, represents a machine learning approach that entails the assignment of one of several conceivable labels to an input image or region of interest, while also incorporating an extra option to reject the image (Figure \ref{fig:selective_classification}). The integration of a reject option in the classification process permits the system to circumvent erroneous diagnoses or recommendations when the input image's classification is uncertain. In lieu of making an incorrect prediction, the system can request supplementary information or refer the image to a human expert for further evaluation. One prevalent strategy for selective classification involves establishing a threshold on the confidence score generated by the classifier; if the confidence score falls below the threshold, the image is discarded.



\section{Dataset Generalisation}
The majority of research in the field of medical image analysis employs open-source datasets~\citep{wu2022skin}. Open-source datasets are publicly released datasets intended to facilitate further research. While such datasets have aided advancements in this area, the resulting machine learning models are often not amenable to generalisation across disparate datasets captured at different sites~\citep{chin2022prepare}. It is essential for machine learning models to generalise across medical data from distinct capture sites to achieve broad applicability and effectiveness in diverse clinical contexts. Failure to do so may result in suboptimal performance and inaccuracies that can adversely impact clinical decision-making in medical applications where precision and accuracy are paramount. For example, if a model trained on imaging data from one hospital is applied to imaging data from a different hospital that employs distinct imaging technology, it may generate erroneous results that could lead to incorrect diagnoses and treatments.

\section{Thesis Structure}
\label{sec:thesis_structure}
This thesis is organised into separate chapters corresponding to the major contributions made. Each chapter includes an exposition of the underlying motivations, a survey of the pertinent literature, and an account of the conducted experiments. This section presents a succinct overview of the individual chapters:

\subsection*{Annotator Efficient Active Learning}
With the increasing popularity of deep learning in medical image analysis and digital pathology~\citep{tizhoosh2018artificial}, it has become increasingly important to develop methods that can reduce the need for costly data annotations. Active learning is a promising approach to minimising the amount of annotated data required to train machine learning models~\citep{settles2009active}. However, the effectiveness of traditional active learning strategies with deep learning is limited~\citep{wang2016cost}. In patch-based machine learning systems, active learning methods typically request annotations for individual small patches, which can be laborious and expensive for annotators who must rely on visual context. To address this issue, Chapter~\ref{ch:active_learning} proposes an active learning framework that selects tiles for annotation that are composed of multiple patches, which is expected to increase annotation throughput~\citep{carse2019active}. This framework is evaluated with various query strategies on the task of nuclei classification, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on small patches containing single nuclei. Traditional query strategies performed worse than random sampling.

\subsection*{Unsupervised Representation Learning}
Recent advancements in deep learning algorithms have had a significant impact on digital pathology tasks. However, a significant challenge in this field is the need for large amounts of annotated data. To overcome this issue, unsupervised learning techniques, particularly contrastive predictive coding (CPC)~\citep{oord2018representation}, have been proposed to leverage abundant but unannotated data for training classifiers. In Chapter~\ref{ch:unsupervised_representation_learning}, a modification to the CPC framework for use in digital pathology patch classification is purposed, which involves the use of an alternative mask to construct the latent context and a multi-directional PixelCNN autoregressor~\citep{oord2016pixel}. Using the Path Camelyon histology patch dataset~\citep{veeling2018rotation}, it is demonstrated that this proposed method can produce effective deep feature representations for improved classification accuracy in digital pathology when compared to the standard implementation of CPC~\citep{carse2021unsupervised}.

\subsection*{Predictive Probability Calibration}
It is well established that deploying deep learning classifiers for medical image analysis tasks requires careful consideration of issues related to predictive calibration~\citep{maron2019systematic}. Mis-calibration, defined as the discrepancy between predictive probability (confidence) and classification correctness~\citep{guo2017calibration}, can significantly impact the ability to make cost-sensitive and selective decisions~\citep{carse2021robust}. To understand the effectiveness of various calibration methods, Chapter~\ref{ch:classification_claibration} reports empirical study was conducted on two medical image datasets: one for multi-class dermatology classification and one for binary histopathology image classification. The chapter applied the temperature scaling method, in which the temperature parameter is optimised using various calibration measures instead of the standard negative log-likelihood, to networks trained with one-hot encoding and cross-entropy loss, as well as networks trained with focal loss and label smoothing. The results of these methods were compared to those obtained using two Bayesian neural network approaches. The findings suggest that while alternative calibration metrics may not offer significant advantages for tuning temperature, temperature scaling of networks trained with focal loss and appropriate hyperparameters demonstrated strong performance in terms of both calibration and accuracy across both datasets~\citep{carse2022calibration}.

\newpage
\subsection*{Asymmetrical Selective Classification}
Skin lesion classifiers must enable decision-making that is sensitive to cost. Chapter~\ref{ch:selective_classification} investigates techniques for selective, cost-sensitive classification in both binary triage and multi-class disease classification scenarios, using misclassification costs provided by clinical dermatologists based on healthcare economics. The chapter evaluates various methods of uncertainty estimation with neural networks and probability calibration. Additionally, a modification to SelectiveNet~\citep{geifman2019selectivenet}, called EC-SelectiveNet~\citep{carse2021robust} is proposed, that discards the selection head during testing and relies on expected costs to make decisions. The results demonstrate the advantages of training for full coverage, even when operating at lower coverage, and show that EC-SelectiveNet outperforms standard CNNs using temperature scaling~\citep{guo2017calibration} or Bayesian neural networks using different measures of uncertainty, in both symmetric and asymmetric cost settings.

\subsection*{Cross Site Generalisation}
Chapter~\ref{ch:dataset_generalisation} examines the generalisability of deep neural network classifiers for macroscopic skin lesion images in the UK NHS. Although deep learning has shown promise in dermatology, its ability to accurately diagnose macroscopic skin disease images that lack dermoscopic information remains a significant challenge~\citep{jones2022artificial}. To address this, four diagnostic image datasets were utilised, including two locally-sourced datasets and two publicly available datasets. Two types of neural network models were trained and evaluated on each dataset, with pre-training on the SD-260~\citep{yang2019self} dataset followed by fine-tuning on the target domain data showing the most promising results. This chapter emphasises the importance of assessing the generalisability of deep learning algorithms for macroscopic skin lesion images in real-world settings and highlights the potential benefits of utilising large public macroscopic datasets for pre-training and fine-tuning. Future research is necessary to evaluate the generalisability of these algorithms across different populations and acquisition settings.

\subsection*{Conclusions and Discussions}
This chapter briefly articulated and introduced the research conducted, elucidating its contributions and limitations. It highlighted the potential for cost-effective annotation and predictive triage diagnosis in the realm of medical image analysis, with particular emphasis on histopathology and dermatology. This thesis lays groundwork for future research to build upon. This chapter underscores the criticality of mitigating annotation costs and triage misdiagnose, to promote the widespread utilisation of medical image analysis systems in clinical settings.
